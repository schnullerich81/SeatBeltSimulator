# SeatBeltSimulator

This is a DIY project for enthusiastic sim racers.

**Motivation**
During some research about 'how to improve my sim rig' i stumbled across 'motion platforms'.
I made 2 discoveries:

 - they are ridiculously expensive
 - 'less is more' - see https://youtu.be/ytE1olTEfog

One of the problems of most of the motion platforms is the missing simulation of sustained breaking forces, which can be solved relatively easy by adding a separate seatbelt system. 
This part of the video explains that very good: https://youtu.be/ytE1olTEfog?t=241
Here is a link to a seatbelt system by vesaro https://www.vesaro.com/store/pc/viewPrd.asp?idproduct=502&idcategory=327. It is very expensive on its own - and needs a vesaro motion platform to work with.

So the idea is to build a seatbelt system that works with standard sim rigs.

Please note that 
 - the seatbelt system makes some noise - so it works best with headphones or VR headsets
